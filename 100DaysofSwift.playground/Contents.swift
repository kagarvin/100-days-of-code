// Summary
/*  1. You make variables using var and constants using let.
    2. Itâ€™s preferable to use constants as often as possible.
    3. Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.
    4. Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, and booleans hold true or false.
    5. String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.
    6. Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want. */

// Arrays - lists!

let array_reverse: [String] = [thing5, thing4, thing3, thing2, thing1]

// Sets - Unlike arrays, stored in random order and all items must be unique (cannot appear more than once)
let set = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // see how the output order is not the same as the input?
let set2 = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 2]) // notice how 4 and 2 only appear in the output once

// Tupples - store several values together in a single value, cannot remove item (fixed sizes) and cannot change item types (same as created)
var tup = (first: "Kayla", age: 24, weightatbrith: 8.2)
tup.0
tup.age
tup.2
let tup2 = (item1: 1, item2: "two", item3: 3.1)
// var tup = (first: "Kayla", age: 24, last: Garvin) - will not work because item type was changed

// Arrays vs. Sets vs. Tuples
// Tuples: a specific, fixed collection of related values where each item has a precise position or name
let address = (house: 7899, street: "118A Street", city: "Delta")
// Sets:  a collection of values that must be unique or you need to be able to check whether a specific item is in there extremely quickly
let elements = Set(["Antimony", "Arsenic", "Aluminum", "Selenium", "Hydrogen", "Oxygen", "Nitrogen", "Rehinum"])
// Array: a collection of values that can contain duplicates, and the order of items matter (most common of all three)
let score = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Dictionaries - like arrays, but items are not stored in an integer position
let definition = [
    "Earth": "The surface of the world as distinct from the sky or sea.",
    "Sea": "A body of water that covers most of the earth's surface.",
]
// Note: When using type annotations, dictionaries are written in brackets with a colon between your identifier and value types. For example, [String: Double] and [String: String].

// Dictonary Default Values - This allows us to set a response to reading a non existant value

    "First": "1",
    "Second": "2",
    "Third": "3"
